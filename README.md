# WikiRace-Showdown
WikiRace Showdown is a multiplayer web game where players race through Wikipedia articles by clicking hyperlinks to reach a randomly chosen target page. Starting from a given article, players must navigate only by clicking in-article links until they arrive at the target. The game includes solo and multiplayer modes, real-time leaderboards, and a replay system that visualizes the paths taken.
